Write a function named expo that takes two arguments. Both arguments are positive numbers or zero. The second number is what the first number should be raised to. See example below. Remember any number raised to the zeroth power is 1. You are recreating Math.pow() so do not use it in your solution.

expo(3,3) 3^3=> 9
expo(2, 4) 2^4=> 16
